The [[Dark Age]] long ago when magic was only used by seven families, the [[Septemi]].
Then the legendary mage [[Admus]] wanted magic more accessible for all people.
This split the families, four being against it and three being for it.
There was a war while [[Admus]] tried to shift the material plane into a position that would allow magic energy to flood the world. 
The ritual was successful, but [[Admus]] died in the end and so began the Age of Arcana.
The Age of Arcana has been going for eons and a lot has happened: new races have settled, a pantheon of gods has made the world their home and a lot of people have become powerful.
