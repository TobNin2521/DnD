The world of [[Lathun]] is a new addition to the material plane. It came here after the great mage [[Admus]] used a ritual to plane-shift the whole world. Before its arrival in the material plane, magic was a rare gift that only ran in a few select bloodlines. This age of [[Lathun]] is now called the [[Dark Age]]. After the successful plane-shift performed by [[Admus]], magic started to flood the world, leading to more mages being born and people developing special abilities. Scholars still debate what to call this Age of [[Lathun]], but the accepted term around the common folk is the [[Age of Arcana]]. 
[[Lathun]] is full of different races, but is primarily inhibited by humans. The world does not contain classical kingdoms, but is instead divided into zones of influence by seven families, the [[Septemi]].
